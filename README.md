# Soil-Quality-Sensor
Developing a system composed by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller that receives data from a 7-in-1 soil quality sensor (C language used for programming). The data is then transmitted via Wi-Fi using using the MQTT protocol to a Raspberry Pi 4 that also acts as an access point. The IoT platform to which the data is transmitted is ThingsBoard, this being installed on the Raspberry Pi. Also, a PCB was developed for the ensamble formed by the microcontroller-sensor-transceiver to make a better wire managemenet for the system. In addition, a report was written and a comparison with other implementations of this project was made.
